# track-my-ipv6

Simple little script for me to watch the IPv6 addresses on my macbook as they [keep changing over and over](https://yaleman.org/post/2021/2021-03-30-ipv6-address-keeps-changing-on-macos-with-pfsense/).

Logs to [Splunk](https://splunk.com) via the [HEC](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) because I log everything.
